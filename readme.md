# Thanks for looking at my portfolio!

You're welcome to check out the code behind it (I definitely had some fun with the js), but be sure to take a look at the thing itself! It's deployed at https://samuelrkramer.github.io/

_Hint: If you want to see the project wake-up modal in action, you'll need to avoid the wake-up pings it sends to all the projects immediately on loading. Visit https://samuelrkramer.github.io/?nowake=1 instead._
